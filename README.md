Currently just exploring different dataset options, the one currently in the project looks promising, documentation found here: https://github.com/mila-iqia/ddxplus
Installed these packages: pip install fastapi uvicorn pandas numpy pydantic sentence-transformers
Decided to use an LLM generated dataset for RAG instead.
